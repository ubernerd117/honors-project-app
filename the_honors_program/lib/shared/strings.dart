Honors students can start their project at any point in their college journey from freshman to senior year. However, some majors recommend starting at a specific time to better manage the project. \n Contact your honors advisor to help you customize your schedule and plan when it would be best for you.';

Typical awards range from \$250-600 for research and scholarly work and \$600-2000 travel-related proposals. Application deadlines for the proposal are due on October 1 and March 1.

In addition, Honors 4980 is required before Honors 4990, but there is no need to do both courses in consecutive semesters.

You will not be able to register for Honors 4980 yourself. \n The HNRS 4980 form asks you for some basic information, including your contact information, the names of your Honors & faculty advisors and the working title of your project.

  static const String honorsProjectLengthGuidelines = '''
The Faculty Advisors will set the appropriate length given standards for similar works within a given discipline/field of study. Faculty Advisors should keep these ideas in mind these guidelines when determining an appropriate length:

1. The Honors Project is not intended as a Master’s Thesis.
2. The Honors Project is not an “ordinary” paper for a course; rather, it is the culmination of the Honors student experience.
3. Projects typically result in papers of around 25 pages but may vary in length.

  static const String facultyAdvisorResponsibilities = '''
The Faculty Advisors' primary responsibility is to help the student lay out the basic conception of the project, clarify the student’s objectives, and discover an appropriate research or creative strategy for achieving these.

Advisors typically provide reading lists for students or augment lists prepared by the students themselves, as well as assistance when problems arise. Faculty advisors must guide students through the IRB process or certify that the project being produced does not require IRB approval. Finally, they critique one or more early drafts of the project and jointly assign the finished project a grade.

  static const String facultyAdvisorQualifications = '''
Faculty members at the University with the rank of Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, or Qualified Rank Faculty (Teaching, Clinical, or Research Professor/Associate Professor/Assistant Professor) can serve as an Honors Project advisor. A non-faculty member or an adjunct faculty member with special expertise in the student's area may serve as a third advisor but may not be one of the student's two primary advisors and may not grade the project.

### Guidelines for Searching:
- **Use Relevant Search Terms**: Start by using keywords related to your **major**, such as *Biology*, *Business*, *Psychology*, etc.
- **Narrow Down by Area of Interest**: If you have a specific area of interest, include relevant terms like *sustainability*, *artificial intelligence*, *cultural studies*, or *environmental science*.
- **Search by Advisor**: If you know the name of a specific advisor who has overseen multiple projects in your field, you can include their name in your search.
- **Search by Year**: You can refine your search by the year the project was completed to find more recent work or trends.
- **Combine Keywords**: For the best results, try combining several terms, like your major, area of interest, and advisor’s name to narrow down the results.

Once you've located relevant projects, you can use them as inspiration or guidance for your own work. Good luck with your search!
